<!-- 
	If a mod requires access to the full lua api e.g. os.* io.* it has to request acesss via 'request_no_api_restrictions="1"'.
	It is recommended that other options are explored first, as we may completely disable those APIs in the future.
	By default mods have access to the table, string, math and bit libraries and to the APIs exposed by the game.
